Hence, the lengthy explanations for the numbers derived below.

The previous IRS adjustment for 2021 indicated that the $5,000 indicated in the original law, adjusted for inflation, is $5,940 (the difference between $14,820 and $8,880. So that's $17,550, a number confirmed by CRS and other reports. CRS indicates this plateau's end is $11,610 for single filers, $17,550 for married ones.

					#The income limits or "income thresholds" for the EITC are mathematically derived from the numbers above, according to the EITC law, in federal statute "26 USC 32: Earned income," as follows: "The amount of the credit allowable to a taxpayer under paragraph (1) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of (A) the credit percentage of the earned income amount, over (B) the phaseout percentage of so much of the adjusted gross income (or, if greater, the earned income) of the taxpayer for the taxable year as exceeds the phaseout amount."  Using the variable designations (and $eitc_recd for the amount of EITC received, and $eitc_income_limit for these thresholds, this translates to

					# When setting $eitc_recd to 0, the two numbers emerging from this equality for $eitc_income_limit are $21,427 and $27,367. These are not widely discussed figures but are reflected in charts in the CRS document and other documents related to the ARPA changes.
