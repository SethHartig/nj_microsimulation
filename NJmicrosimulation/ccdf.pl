		#  STEP 2: DETERMINE FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR CCDF SUBSIDIES
		# From NJ CCDF state plan: Income is defined as the amount of current gross income earned by all members of the family unit through the receipt of wages including overtime, tips, bonuses or commissions from activities in which he/she is engaged as an employee from his/her self-employment. Unearned income such as social security, pensions, retirement, unemployment, worker's compensation, public assistance, child support, alimony and any other income required for federal and state tax reporting purposes is calculated in the income. foster care payments are not included because they are not taxable income.
		#
		# Note: although Social Security income is included in income tabulations, child SSI is explicitly exempted, but adult SSI is not. 
		#Investigate whether it's only the children that are receiving ccdf (age < 13) whose ssi income is exempted or if it's all child ssi income that is excluded (even if age > 13). No official documentation on this is easily accessible, but kept as below, with all child ssi income is excluded. In this application for care assistance online, provider does not ask about any child's earned or unearned income, only the parents/adults: https://ccrnj.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Entire-Application-File-3.1.2021.pdf. 

		$ccdf_income = $out->{'earnings'} + $out->{'interest'} + $out->{'child_support_recd'} + $out->{'tanf_recd'} + ($out->{'ssi_recd'} - $out->{'child_ssi_recd'}) + $out->{'fli_plus_tdi_recd'} + $out->{'ui_recd'} + $in->{'spousal_support_ncp'}; #Assuming that fli and tdi benefits are treated the same way as UI.
		$ccdf_poverty_percent = $ccdf_income / $in->{'fpl'};
		
		# 
		# Page 43  of the child care subsidy manual clarifies exit eligibility income requirements. Technically, this also includes assets not exceeding $1,000,000, but I think we can leave out the millionaires for now. Return to include assets in this, time permitting.

		# One possible policy option for either reducing co-pays or qualifying for child care subsidies might be to use policy triggers to incentivize businesses to offer dependent care flexible spending accounts to their employees, which allow employees to deposit pre-tax earnings into an account dedicated to paying for costs such as child care. Having access to an account like this would seem to allow employee earnings to fall below income eligibility thresholds for a number of programs (e.g. CCDF, SNAP, and TANF), which would be helpful  if cash or near-cash benefits from those programs increase net resources by more than the amount that families might lose by no longer qualifying for the child and dependent care tax credit, which I think would no longer be available if enrolled in a dependent care FSA. For all these benefit programs, we'd also have to check whether funds in a dependent care FSA count as assets (or if assets that spent in the same month they are received are not actually assets).

		# Note: I noticed this while writing the CCDF requirements, but as currently construed our family structures do not include non-parent adult dependents (e.g., attending college). Consider revising in later iterations of the FRS.
		#FOSTER FAMILIES are categorically eligible for ccdf as long as their income is less than 250% of fpl. See NJAC 10:15-5.3 - about out-of-home placement. foster care is a type of out of home placement - see definitions of foster home and out of home placement in section 10:15-1.2.

			# STEP 3: CHECK WORK REQUIREMENTS

			#From our reading of Section 10 90-5.2 of the New Jersey administrative code, it seems that New Jerseyâ€™s WFNJ/TANF program will provide access to child care pay for all child care free of charge for TANF recipients. "Payment of child care services, including after-school child care in the case of a child over six years of age and care for children with special needs, shall be available for WFNJ/TANF eligible dependent children during the recipient's period of eligibility and for the 24 consecutive months following ineligibility for cash benefits as a result of earned income or other circumstances as described in this subchapter. Depending upon the type of child care program, payment for child care services will be provided in accordance with N.J.A.C. 10:15 and appropriate child care co-payment procedures at N.J.A.C. 10:15-9." So this is not free child care, but ensures child care at the rates specified  via CCDF eligibiltiy and allows a family coming off TANF to not be bound by CCDF work requirements.

This likely allows for CCDF eligibitiy in some states.

If more than two children in a family are receiving child care services, no co-payment shall be required for the third and subsequent children in the family. The Client Income Eligibility and Co-Payment Schedule for Subsidized Child Care Assistance or Services set forth as the chapter Appendix shall be revised on an annual basis through a notice of administrative change published in the New Jersey Register. The co-payment chart calculation is based on the Health and Human Services (HHS) Poverty Guidelines, which accounts for last (calendar) year's increase in prices as measured by the Consumer Price Index. The HHS Poverty Guidelines is updated and published annually in the Federal Register as a General Notice. The co-payment is a portion of family income that is paid by an eligible family toward the cost of child care that provides for cost sharing by families that receive Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) child care services. The amount of the required co-payment is based on a family's gross annual, income, family size, hours of care needed, and the number of children in care."
