#Interest is derived from the amount entered for familyâ€™s savings in the user-interface	on Step	3.	The	FRS	utilizes the U.S. Department of	Housing	and	Urban Developmentâ€™s	(HUD)	method	for	calculating	interest: when a family has net assets over $5,000,	we apply the national average interest rate, also known as the passbook	savings rate. Savings equal to or less than $5,000 are	assumed	not to accrue interest. The passbook savings rate was 0.06 in 2019, unchanged from 2016, last announced at https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/16-01HSGN.PDF. As with HUD standards, this rate is applied annually, and is not compounded monthly or quarterly. We assume the family does not have any other investments.

      $interest = 0; 
    } else { 
      $interest = $in->{'passbook_rate'} * $in->{'savings'}; 
    }
